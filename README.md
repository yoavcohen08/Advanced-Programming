## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topics:

- **Java Basics/**: Foundational tasks in Java:
  - `TreasureHunt.java`: Decodes clues in a map file to find a treasure.
  - `RandomAccess.java`: Sorts bytes and tri-bytes in a file.
  - `Streams.java`: Processes streams, extracts quoted text, and reads numbers.
  - `TreasureMapDecoder.java`: Interface for decoding map clues.
- **Python E-commerce/**: A shopping app built in Python:
  - `store.py`: Manages items, searches, and shopping cart interactions.
  - `shopping_cart.py`: Handles adding, removing, and totaling items.
  - `item.py`: Represents store items.
  - `errors.py`: Custom error classes for app logic.
  - `main.py`: CLI interface for the app.
  - `items.yml`: YAML file with inventory data.
  - `store_tests.py`: Tests for the Store class.
  - `shopping_cart_tests.py`: Tests for the ShoppingCart class.
  - `pytest.ini`: Configuration for Pytest.
- **SQL with Java/**: A grading system using SQL:
  - `Smarticulous.java`: Manages database connections and user/exercise data.
  - `User.java`: Represents system users.
  - `Exercise.java`: Defines exercises and questions.
  - `Submission.java`: Tracks submissions and grades.
- **Assignments/**: Additional programming tasks (to be added).
- **Projects/**: Larger, complex programming projects (to be added).
- **Notes/**: Personal notes and summaries of lectures.
- **Resources/**: Links and supplementary materials.
